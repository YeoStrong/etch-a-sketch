# Etch-a-Sketch (Neon Edition)

This is a project from The Odin Project. I made a digital sketching board where you can play with grids.

## [Live Demo](https://yeostrong.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Features

- When you hover your mouse on the grids, it changes to a random RGB color.
- I added a "fading out" effect so the colors return to the background color slowly (2 seconds).
- You can change the grid size by clicking the button (e.g., 16x16, 64x64).
- The total size is fixed at 960px, so only the density of the grid changes.

## What I used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox and Transitions)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

## What I learned

- How to create elements dynamically using JavaScript loops.
- How to handle user input with `prompt()` and validate it.
- How to use `box-shadow` to create a neon-like glowing effect.
